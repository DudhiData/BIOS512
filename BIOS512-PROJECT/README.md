The phishing URL dataset was pulled from the Machine Learning Repository website that was given as part of the set of recommended sites. 
It had around 54 features with 1 being the class and around 260,000 observations.
The idea is using a logistic regression with regularization to reduce the number of features needed to allow my hardware to compute this without crashing.
Additionally, the label we are predicting is a binary label, so predicting using a logistic regression is fitting.
