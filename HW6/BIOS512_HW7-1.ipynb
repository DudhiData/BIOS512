It would be rude to push those changes back because it would mess with the other people working on different branches. If you need to push the changes back, then it would be better to use rebase since it wouldn't mess with the other people working with origin/main on their own branches.","metadata":{}},{"id":"65b5eb8a-cee0-4a97-b89c-8746c37669ea","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 6\n#### Match the command/vocab word to the description.\nYou can edit the table!\n\n| Command / Vocab     | Answer | Description |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| git stash          | B | A.
